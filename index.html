        What it is
      </h1>
      <p>The term <strong>updog</strong> is a way to joke around with pals as this would substitute the slang word of <strong>"dawg"</strong><br>to the term dog. This would lead for jokes about the animal dog to try and trick the person that
      it is used against.<br>However, this joke is very predicatable and not funny to a lot of people, but it is one of the most classic jokes every made and served as the base of others.</p>

        How it is used
      </h2>
      <p>An example of using the joke "updog" would be:<br><em>"Does it not smell like updog in here?"<br>"What is updog?"<br>"Not much, how about you."</em><br>
      This shows how it can be used in jokes as this is what updog told me. What is updog you say? Not much, how about you? :) hehe</p>
